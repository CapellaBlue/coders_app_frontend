# coders_app_frontend
Our frontend express app for coding social network

JUST KIDDING: Our app transformed into a political forum app that allows users to semi-anonymously post their political opinions
with political affiliation in the color of the post. The user may also like other posts according to their political
affiliation and comment on posts without needing an account.
The admin user is the only user able to edit and delete content from the site based off her discretion.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
This app utilizes Ruby on Rails for backend with postgresql for a database. The frontend operates with express, angular.js,
bootstrap, and angular UI for bootstrap and is written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Notes to self:
I'd really like to add charts.js to the site to visually inspect all the interesting data coming from the users.
Further, figuring out how to make accordian functionality with angular UI for Bootstrap do my bidding would be stellar."
